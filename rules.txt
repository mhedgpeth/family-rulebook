== Calm Household ==

We all agree that we want to live in a calm house with minimal drama. Therefore, we all agree to these two rules:

1. Children may not yell or cry irrationally.

Consequence:
  * A parent must request that the child goes to his room.
  * If the child does not immediately go to his room, the child will not have screen time for the rest of the day. Mom or Dad will record this in Mom's planner.
    - This means: no slamming doors, no yelling out excuses, no kicking walls, no making the fit even worse, no crawling, no baby stepping, no hurting people along the way, no defamation of property, and the like.
  * If the fit continues, the parent will start a timer. For every minute that the fit continues, the child will not be able to have screen time another day.
  * Once the child is in their room and not heard by those downstairs, the consequences will stop.
  * The child may come down from their room when they deem they are calm.

2. Parents may only yell when there is threat of immediate danger.

Consequence: They must turn off their mobile phone for the rest of the day. The child must say, "You are hurting my eardrums right now; please turn off your phone."
